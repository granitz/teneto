def recruitment(community,system):
    """
    Calculates recruitment coefficient for each node. Recruitment coefficient is the average probability of nodes from the
      same community being in the same communities at other time-points or during different tasks. 
      
    Parameters:
    ------------
    community :  	time,node community vector 
    system : array containing the system assignment for each node
              eg. nodes from the Power parcellation assigned to brain networks

    returns:
    -------
      R : recruitment coefficient for each node
