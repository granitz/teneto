def recruitment(community,system):
	"""
 	Parameters:
 	------------
  Calculates recruitment coefficient for each node. Recruitment coefficient is the average probability of nodes from the
  same community being in the same communities at other time-points or during different tasks. 
  
		community :  	time,node community vector 
    system : array containing the system assignment for each node
        	eg. nodes from the Power parcellation assigned to brain networks
 
    returns:
    -------
      R : recruitment coefficient for each node
